What works in this code
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1) Train the VGG19 network with random initilization 
2) Predict the image with pretrained weights
3) Further Train the pretrained weights

********************************************************************
how to execute the code
********************************************************************

step - 1: Run the make file

step - 2:

For training 
   To train VGG19 with random weights execute following command
          ./exec train random <# of epoch> <optimizer> [Note: code supports sgd+momentum optimizer as of now]
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   Example : ./exec train random 1 sgd_momentum
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   
   To train VGG19 with weights loaded from the text file 
          ./exec train load <path of weights> <# of epoch> <optimizer> [Note: code supports sgd+momentum optimizer as of now]


For Predicting
   To predict execute the following command  [NOTE : This command is not active as of now]
          ./exec predict weights <path of weights> image <path of image>
====================================================================
Pending Items
====================================================================
1) write the weights to a text file
